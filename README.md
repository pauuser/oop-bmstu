# Object-oriented programming course

These are assignments of OOP course taken during my BMSTU studies. The assignments turned out be 8000+ lines of C++20 code. The course covered lots of topics from fundamentals of OOP and lots of patterns from GoF to event modelling in C++ and object-oriented analysis.
